FEWD assignment 1

## New Year! New Class!


I am excited about learning new things again! Last year after the FEWD 1, 
I had finally had few vacation trips and am feeling refreshed!


## Introductions
Hello! I'm **Mika**, AKA, _**MotoKitty**_!

 
I have five cats.

Their names are:
* Benjamin Johnson Lee
* Zooey Morrison
* Penny Lane
* Moses Igotthejoker
* Thunder "Scoot" Brooks


I also love motorcycles. Here are some pictures from the races I went to:
